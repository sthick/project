            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pitching Analysis</button>
            <p>After we started with two new data collection devices, FlightScope and Rapsodo, there was an extreme amount of data that the coaches did not know how to use.  This information overflow made it hard for them to parse through the data and look at numbers they wanted to analyze.  The pitching coach and video coordinator approached me with this issue and requested an excel file that does easy calculations on a limited number of the data sets.  In response I created a macro based excel file that allowed the pitching coach to look more closely at the data and analyze it based on pitcher, date, and more.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Player Profile Dashboard</button>
            <p>I lead a team of fellow student sports analysts in creating a Tableau dashboard for the coaching staff that consisted of all BIG10 teams and profiles for each individual player.  We scraped play-by-play data from the NCAA softball website for every game played in the BIG10 starting in 2019 and gets updated after each new game is played.  The dashboard consists of a hitting spray chart, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, batting outcome by count, runs created, and number of quality at bats that can be filtered by team or player at the user's discretion.  The goal of this project was for the coaches to be able to look at upcoming opponent's as well as our own team's performance with full control of which players or teams are represented on the dashboard.  This project is continuously growing as we add new data and create new statistcs based on feedback and requests from the coaches.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">New Feature Creations for Application</button>
            <p>Throughout the summer my main project focus was updating and improving the internally built application called "Unicorn".  This automotive security application for full-scale automotive production is actively being used by large automotive companies for CAN bus (Controller Area Network) testing within their vehicles.  My priority was to identify and fix bugs throughout the application as we worked to commercialize the application and recieved feedback from customers.  This process lead me to implement new features into the application including a Time Setting that allows the user to manually control the amount of time spent on different CAN bus test cases and guages that display system load while specificly taxing tests are running and is hidden while irrelevant tests are being performed.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Reconciling Errors within Application</button>
            <p>Through fuzz testing errors within the back end and front end connection were discovered leading me to create tests within the application that check that tasks being performed in the back end are properly represented on the front end and when data does not match error messages appear.  Similarly, when our clients ran the application for the first time as an executable file they continuosly were getting errors with the virtual environment creation due to connectivity issues with the original PowerShell script and updates made in the application.  I was tasked with rewriting the PowerShell script in order to remove the error message and solve the connection issues.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Redesign and Reconfiguration of Application Materials</button>
            <p>Utalizing my background in graphic design and visualization I was asked to do a complete redesign of the application's section of our department's Confluence page.  This process invlolved restructuring the current page in order to add video tutorials and image descriptions in order to make the important information found on the page more understandable and easier to read.  Additionally, as part of the commercialization of the application I was asked to reconfigure the current onboarding documents for new employees and new users.  The materials that were currently being used for these purposes had not been updated since the original launch of the application and used a lot of engineer jargon.  With the deployment of verison 20.2, this process involved copious amounts of reworking step-by-step implementation tutorials that omitted the smaller steps that many engineers overlooked in their initial developmet stages.   </p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">LeagueApps</button>
            <p>Part 1:<br>I was given the job to pull data from LeagueApps camp data that was unusable by the marketing department because of the form the data was in.  I did this by creating a lambda function to take relevant information gathered through camp/clinic registration from LeagueApps API and store it in the company's Amazon S3 bucket as a json file for future use.  This process previously was done every morning by a marketing employee who had to log into the LeagueApps website, download the necessary information as a csv file, clean the data to make it readable removing unnecessary information and checking for duplicate registrationIDs, and saving it for future use.  With the creation of this lambda there is no longer a need for manual labor because after deploying the code it will run every morning saving the information to the necessary location in an easily scrapable file as well as a file that is easy to read and access.<br><br>Part 2:<br>After pulling LeagueApps information we now wanted to add this information to the customer profile information the Cavaliers have been accumulating for years.  I was assigned with adding the new information from LeagueApps to the customer profile as well as updating the customer profile information that was already there.  The program I created pulls the customer profile information and LeagueApps information and checks for duplicates, updated existing information, and adds the the new contacts to the profile.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Historical Page Update</button>
            <p>In preparation for a history of the Cleveland Cavaliers website a history of each team for the last fifty years was created and saved in a google spreadsheet.  Each team had its own worksheet filled with information from that year (e.g. Players, coaches, uniforms, ect).  This google spreadsheet needed to be added to an Amazon S3 bucket as a json file in order to be scraped and used for website creation. I was approached with the task of finding the easiest, and cheapest way to update an S3 bucket with a file for each year every time a change was made to that particular google spreadsheet.  The program I wrote allows that to happen because once deployed the runtime was set to every 4 seconds, therefore if a change is made the S3 bucket will be updated with that change almost immediately.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Facebook Ad Data</button>
            <p>I was asked to pull the Facebook Ad data for all Cavalier related accounts and add them to our Looker Dashboards and Amazon S3 buckets for future analysis.  This required communicating with team members in order to get the correct access credentials for the Facebook accounts as well as learning and implementing the facebook API.  Once the data was pulled it was added to the Looker connections where I cleaned the data and used it to make visualizations for the marketing department.</p>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Looker Research</button>
            <p>After meeting with a member of the basketball operations team who has used Looker for work they are doing our team decided to explore its use for the development team to find out if the cost would be worth it.  I was given a login and put in charge of learning the ins and outs of Looker and reporting back to my superiors on the effectiveness of the application.</p>
